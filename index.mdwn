# Non-monogamy Ireland

This is a community for people who believe that relationships come in different
sizes and shapes, and that monogamy is not always the answer.

---

The group aims to provide a non-commercial safe space for the non-monogamous
people of Ireland, irrespective of their sexual orientation, gender identity
and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

A space for discussion, creation, and organisation that exists on-line and
off-line. Safe because a group within the community will create and enforce a
code of conduct to protect the community members from any harassment. Posting
is free, but abuse will be swiftly suppressed.

# Facebook group

While we know that Facebook does not respect our privacy adequately, it was the
simplest way to start the community. Until we find a suitable alternative, the
place to discuss online is in the
[FB group page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nonmonogamous.ie/).
