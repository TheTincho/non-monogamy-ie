# New social meet

After last weeks' successful kick-off meeting, I want to announce a second
meeting, next Tuesday evening.

I haven't yet found a place, but it will be decided in the next few days, stay
tuned for updates.

Also, I am testing using Evenbrite to manage the event, which does not have
Facebook problems with privacy, and it is free to use for free events!

Please, let me know if you find any issues with the event page, as it is the
first time I am using this platform.

You can already register, and get notified automatically when the location is
announced.
