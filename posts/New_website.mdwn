# New website

If you are reading this, you will have already noticed that now our little
group has a web presence outside of Facebook.

I will be posting announcements and group information here. Discussions will
stay in [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nonmonogamous.ie/) for now,
until a better platform is found.

If you are old-school like me, you can find the RSS button at the end of the
page to receive updates in your favourite newsreader.
